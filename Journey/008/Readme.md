# Authorize with Shared Key
## Introduction

I one of my projects I try to set better security options for blob storage and here it comes Shared Key access. 

## Use Case

- Mobile application access various data (images/PDFs) stored in Azure Blob
- SAS tokens are not useful in this scenario so I start to play with Shared Key access

## Cloud Research

- [Authorize with Shared Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-shared-key#specifying-the-authorization-header)
