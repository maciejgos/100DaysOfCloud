# ARM templates - Getting Started

## Introduction

I want to introduce Infrastructure as a Code and Azure Pipelines in one of my projects.

## Use Case

- Setup whole infrastructure from pipeline
- Have infrastructure as a JSON file to track changes

## Cloud Research

- I spend all yesterday evening and today morning on study of ARM templates structure. Finally I was able to setup whole used infrastructure from template via PowerShell script.
- Infrastructure contains:
    * Function App
    * Table Storage
    * Blob Storage
    * API Management
    * Application Insights
- In next days still I need to:
    * Setup Azure Pipeline
    * Learn how to connect services in pipeline (script???)
    * How to load data into new infrastructure using automation
