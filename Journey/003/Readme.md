# ARM Templates & GitHub Actions #100DaysOfCloud

## Cloud Research

- I try to setup ARM & GitHub Action to automatically:
    - create test environment
    - create database
    - deploy application
    - execute some e2e tests

Currently I must rethink strategy of database deployment. In current setup I have dynamic connection string which produce some problems with GitHub Actions.
GitHub Actions does not have support for variables defined in code or I misunderstood something.
